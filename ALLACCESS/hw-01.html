            Favorire paragraph in my favorite novel: <br/> 
            <br/>
            <em>
                "I wanted so badly to lie down next to her on the couch, to wrap my arms around her and sleep. Not fuck, like in those movies. Not even have sex. Just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase. But I lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was drizzle and she was hurricane."
            </em>
            <br/>
            <strong> <em> ["Looking for Alaska" - John Green] </em></strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            And after that, I take that name "Alaska" - the main character in that novel as my name in English.
